<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ighodaro Osatohanmwen Eric. I come from Nigeria, Edo State, Benin City. I'm currently living in Germany for approximately a year now.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm taking a course on Udemy to become a Web Developer. I do this mainly on my free time because I work as well here.</p>

<p>For my hobbies, I like playing football, and table tennis. I cook most times too and I used to love watching cartoons, football and tv when I was a kid but now not anymore haha. I really don't know why though. Well maybe because I'm older now or something.</p>
